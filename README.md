## MQU Machine Learning Reading Group



The reading group has been running weekly for several years within the
[Department of Computing](http://comp.mq.edu.au), [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/) (although we've only set
up this github page in 2018).

We meet on Wednesday afternoons (unless otherwise specified *),
2.00-3.30pm in the Department's seminar room: [9WW
357](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/contacts-and-maps/maps).  All are
welcome to join us.
