## MQU Language Technology Group


This group meets weekly within the
[Department of Computing](http://comp.mq.edu.au), [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/).

We meet on Monday mornings 11.00-12.30pm in room 221, 4 Research Park Drive.  
All are welcome to join us.

Contact [Diego Molla](http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~diego/) if you'd like to get more information or to join the mailing list.
